API for property manangement.

I have developed all the mandatory endpoints and also one additional API endpoint namely, 
- create_new_property
- fetch_property_details
- update_property_details
- find_cities_by_state

Tech Stack used:
- Python
- Flask Framework
- PostgreSQL database

## How to use the API?
- Fork and clone this repository or download the code.
- Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the code.
- Add your password and port number for PostgreSQL in the `app.py` file.
- Run the app using the command `python app.py` in your terminal.
- Open Postman or any other API testing tool and provide appropriate methods, URLs and input to see the output.
